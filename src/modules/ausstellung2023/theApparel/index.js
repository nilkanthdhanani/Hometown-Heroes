                    <p>In the future, we will also produce shirts and hoodies, and for each Hometown Heroes edition, a matching collection will be released. These clothing items will be in an oversized fit, made from high-quality, durable fabric, with a strong emphasis on quality. They are not just ordinary clothes; wearing them supports the message of Hometown Heroes: "Equal as Humans, Despite Differences." Each collection will be limited in quantity to create a sense of rarity and collectibility.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the designs for each edition will be individually crafted to align with the specific country where Hometown Heroes has been active. This means there will be country-specific collections. Additionally, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of these products will be donated back to the respective country of the collection to provide direct support on-site.</p>
