                <p>The fundamental idea behind Hometown Heroes is to create a platform that amplifies the voices of people in suppressed communities. Hometown Heroes represents not just a creative endeavor, but an inspiring movement dedicated to supporting those who are oppressed in their hometowns - be it due to political, religious, or racial circumstances, including government corruption. Our mission is to tell their stories of oppression and spread the universal message of equality and humanity - "Equal as Humans - Despite differences". We harness the power of art to raise awareness, nurture empathy, and drive social change. Our endeavors aim to strengthen commitment and solidarity  for a more just world.</p>
